# HandRaiser
While our classes were temporarily suspended due to COVID-19, Logan McGovern and myself, Matthew Albert, started this project. The objective is to provide an easy way for teachers to get feedback from students in an online class.
Hand Raiser allows individuals to create rooms, have other join it, create quick polls and track whose hand is raised!
Feel free to contribute to this open source project on GitHub.
Donations are greatly appreciated to cover server costs and keep this website free.<br/>
